**Project title**
Operating Systems Assignment 4: Bankers Algorithm
**Motivation**
The goal of this assignment is to design and implement all functions required to perform a bankers algorith
that interacts with the user and utilises multithreading. 
The project will be developed exclusively in C and in a single file.
**Installation**
The only installation involved in the development of this program included the downloading makefile which was used to help facilitate the command line testing on the program. The make file passes in the paramaters required for function to run.
**Individual contribution **(Function-wise)**
all contributions to this assignment were made by Shane Riley.
**Features**
The program first takes command line entries at the time the function is called by the user. These entries represent the currently available resources. The maximum resources are read from the file for each customer and the need value is calculated based off of the maximum requred resources - the currently allocated resources. Once we have found our need values we can calculate if there are enough available resources to allocate the customers request and if so a safe state is found and request is fulfilled.
